## Data Collection and Preprocessing
The data for this dataset was extracted from various PDF files provided by the Norman, Oklahoma police department's [webiste](https://www.normanok.gov/public-safety/police-department/crime-prevention-data/department-activity-reports). The URLs for these PDF files were provided in a separate file, which was used as input to the data processing script. The script read the PDF files, extracted the relevant information, and performed data augmentation to generate the additional fields.

## Data Augmentation
The data augmentation process involved generating the following additional fields:

- **Day of the Week**: Determined by parsing the date information from the source records and converting it to a day of the week value (1-7).
- **Time of Day**: Determined by parsing the time information from the source records and converting it to the hour of the day (0-24).
- **Weather**: Determined by analyzing the weather description in the source records and mapping it to the corresponding WMO weather code.
- **Location Rank**: Determined by ranking the locations based on their frequency, preserving ties.
- **Side of Town**: Determined by calculating the approximate direction of the location relative to the center of town coordinates.
- **Incident Rank**: Determined by ranking the incident types based on their frequency, preserving ties.
- **EMSSTAT**: Determined by checking if the Incident ORI was EMSSTAT or if the subsequent record or two contained an EMSSTAT at the same time and location.

## Dataset Limitations and Biases
The dataset may have geographic or demographic biases, as the source PDF files may not be representative of the entire population. Additionally, the data quality and completeness may be limited by the quality and consistency of the source records.

Specifically, be sure to include:- What does each item/data point represent (e.g., a document, a photo, a person, a country)? - How many items are in the dataset? - What data is available about each item (e.g., if the item is a person, available data might include age, gender, device usage, etc.)? Is it raw data (e.g., unprocessed text or images) or features (variables)? - For static datasets: What timeframe does the dataset cover (e.g., tweets from January 2010â€“December 2020)?**

-> The dataset comprises augmented incident data sourced from PDF files provided by the Norman, Oklahoma police department's [webiste](https://www.normanok.gov/public-safety/police-department/crime-prevention-data/department-activity-reports). Each entry encapsulates a singular incident documented by the police department, ranging from criminal activities to accidents or other events necessitating police intervention. These entries offer a detailed glimpse into the occurrences within Norman, Oklahoma, serving as a valuable resource for subsequent analysis and decision-making processes.

Each incident entry in the dataset is accompanied by a variety of data fields, furnishing comprehensive information about the incident's nature and contextual details. These fields include the day of the week, time of day, weather conditions, location rank, side of town, incident type rank, incident description, and an EMSSTAT indicator. Through data augmentation techniques, additional variables are generated to enhance the dataset, such as inferred day of the week, hour of the incident, and rankings based on frequency, facilitating deeper insights into the incidents recorded by the Norman, Oklahoma police department and aiding in comprehensive analysis of law enforcement trends and patterns in the region.

## Intended & Inappropriate uses

**7. What are the intended purposes for this dataset?**

-> The purpose of this dataset is to practice and learn data augmentation as part of CIS6930-Data Engineering Assignment project 2.
